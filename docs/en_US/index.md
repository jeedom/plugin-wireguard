# Wireguard plugin

This plugin allows you to connect Jeedom to a Wireguard server.

It can also be used by the Jeedom DNS service to replace the **Openvpn plugin** to access your Jeedom from the internet.

# Configuration

## Plugin configuration

Once the plugin has been downloaded and activated, you must ensure that the dependencies are correctly installed on the general configuration page.

## Client configuration

Wireguard clients can be accessed from the menu **Plugins → Communication → Wireguard**.

Click on a device to access its configuration page :

- **Wireguard customer name** : name of your Wireguard equipment.
- **Parent object** : indicates the parent object to which the equipment belongs.
- **Category** : equipment categories *(can belong to several categories)*.
- **Activate** : allows to make the equipment active.
- **Visible** : allows to make the equipment visible on the dashboard.

If you only use the **Wireguard plugin** to connect to the Jeedom DNS, simply go to the general Jeedom configuration (**Settings → System → Configuration**), tab **Networks**. Select **Wireguard** in the drop-down menu of the game **DNS Market management** then **Start / restart** VPN connection.

>**INFORMATION**
>
>Regarding access to Jeedom DNS, you have nothing more to do at your level. The plugin will automatically take care of creating the equipment, generating the configuration of the VPN tunnel and then starting the service.

If you want to configure access to a personal Wireguard server, here is the list of client settings available in the plugin :

- **[Interface]** :
    - **Address** (`Address`) : Wireguard client interface address.
    - **Private key** (`PrivateKey`) : Wireguard client private key.
    - **Post-Up** (`PostUp`) : commands to be executed when starting the Wireguard client interface *(facultatif)*.
    - **Post-Down** (`PostDown`) : commands to be executed when the Wireguard client interface is stopped *(facultatif)*.

>**TRICK**
>
>You can use the tag ``#interface#`` in the fields **Post-Up** and **Post-Down** to retrieve the name of the interface used by the Wireguard client.

- **[Peer]** :
    - **Public key** (`PublicKey`) : Wireguard server public key.
    - **End point** (`Endpoint`) : public IP address of the server : listening port *(ip:port)*.
    - **Authorized IPs** (`AllowedIPs`) : list of authorized IP addresses.
    - **Pre-shared key** (`PresharedKey`) : Pre-shared key *(facultatif)*.
    - **Keep the connection** (`PersistentKeepalive`) : link check delay in seconds *(facultatif)*.
